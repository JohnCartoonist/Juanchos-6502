; Cycle-based MOS 6502 microprocessor emulator written in 6502 assembly by Juan Andres Diaz Torres (also known as 'JohnCartoonist') - 2023
;
; The purpose of this emulator is to provide documentation of the MOS 6502 for emulator developers, detailing the microprocessor's functionality at a low-level.
; This project is created for educational purposes. This emulator provides the following:
;
; - Cycle-based emulation of all official 6502 instructions.
; - Cycle-based emulation of all illegal 6502 opcodes (expect for JAM).
; - Emulation of all documented addressing modes.
; - Emulation of arithmetic operations.
; - Emulation of 16-bit additions.
; - Emulation of 16-bit subtractions.
; - Emulation of signed values.
; - Emulation of flags with ADC and SBC.
; - Emulation of decimal mode (BCD).
; - Emulation of jump vectors and stack operations.
; - Emulation of the break flag and the stack.
; - Implementation of the 6502's pinout.
; - Emulation of the power-up state and reset state.
;
; For reference, here is the documentation I've utilized in order to write this emulator: https://www.masswerk.at/6502/6502_instruction_set.html
