# Juanchos-6502
The MOS Technology 6502 is an 8-bit microprocessor that was designed by a small team led by Chuck Peddle for MOS Technology. The design team had formerly worked at Motorola on the Motorola 6800 project; the 6502 is essentially a simplified, less expensive and faster version of that design.

The mission of this emulator is to imitate the 6502 microprocessor's functionality as closely as possible in its assembly language while maintaining human readability. This emulator does not cover cycle timings for the following reasons:

1 - It would take more effort to implement cycle precision.
2 - I believe implementing cycle precision would hinder the human readability aspect of this emulator.

So, because of these reasons, this 6502 microprocessor emulator aims to do the following:

1 - High instruction accuracy at a low level.
2 - Contribute to video game preservation.
3 - Be used as an educational tool for emulator developers.
4 - Increase portability by being contained in a singular assembly script.
