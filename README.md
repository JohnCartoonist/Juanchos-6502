# Juanchos-6502
The MOS Technology 6502 is an 8-bit microprocessor that was designed by a small team led by Chuck Peddle for MOS Technology. The design team had formerly worked at Motorola on the Motorola 6800 project; the 6502 is essentially a simplified, less expensive and faster version of that design.

The mission of this emulator is to reproduce the 6502 microprocessor's instructions in 6502 assembly. This emulator provides the following:

- Cycle-based emulation of all official 6502 instructions.
- Cycle-based emulation of all illegal 6502 opcodes.
- Emulation of all documented addressing modes.
- Emulation of arithmetic operations.
- Emulation of 16-bit additions.
- Emulation of 16-bit subtractions.
- Emulation of signed values.
- Emulation of flags with ADC and SBC.
- Emulation of decimal mode (BCD).
- Emulation of jump vectors and stack operations.
- Emulation of the break flag and the stack.
- Some implementation of the 6502's pinout.
- Emulation of the power-up state and reset state.
